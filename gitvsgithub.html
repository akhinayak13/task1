        Introduction
        <br>
        Git and GitHub are two essential tools used in modern software development. Though they are closely related, they serve different purposes. Understanding their roles helps streamline collaboration, version control, and project management in development teams.
       <br> What is Git?
        Git is a version control system that helps developers track and manage changes to source code over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
        <br>
        Key characteristics of Git:
        <br>
        - It is distributed, meaning every developer has a complete copy of the project history  <br>
        - It enables branching, allowing developers to experiment with features independently. <br>
        - Changes can be reverted, compared, or merged as needed. <br>
        
        Git works locally on your computer and does not require an internet connection unless you're pushing or pulling changes from a remote server. <br>
        What is GitHub? <br>
        GitHub is a cloud-based hosting platform that stores Git repositories online. It enhances Git by adding collaboration features and a user-friendly interface for managing projects.
        <br>
        Key features of GitHub: <br>
        - It provides a central location for storing and sharing Git repositories. <br>
        - Developers can collaborate on projects through features like pull requests and issues. <br>
        - It supports code reviews, team management, project tracking, and automation. <br>
        - GitHub also integrates with tools for continuous integration and deployment. <br>
        How Git and GitHub Work Together <br>
        Developers use Git to track and manage changes on their local machines. They use GitHub to share their repositories with others and collaborate online. GitHub acts as a remote hub where developers can contribute to a common project, review each other's code, and manage contributions in a structured way.
